# VS-Code Preferences/Configurations

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) configurations based on my personal preferences.

**How to**

```text
Install the latest copy or extract the latest zip file.
Run the batch file that will install extensions.

Go to settings.json e.g (C:\Users\Habib\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\)
Paste the "settings.json" file in it.

That's it.
```
